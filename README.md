# Clickify

Clickify is a small Windows app that sits on your screen and follows your mouse. You speak, it looks at your screen, and it talks back with step-by-step answers.

---

## Install (Windows)

1. Open the **[latest release](https://github.com/Praveen1270/clickify/releases/latest)** and download **`Clickify Setup … .exe`**.
2. Run the installer and finish the steps.
3. Start Clickify from the Start menu or your desktop shortcut.

**First time:** If something is missing, the app opens **API keys**. You can also open it from the **tray icon → API keys…**. Keys are stored only on your PC in `%APPDATA%\Clickify\clickify.env`.

| Key        | Needed for                                |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Cartesia   | Listening and speaking (always)           |
| OpenRouter | Default vision model (Gemini 2.5 Flash)   |
| Gemini     | If you pick direct Gemini as vision model |

**No `.exe` on the release page yet?** Someone with the repo can [publish a release](#publish-a-release) or you can build it yourself: `npm install`, then `npm run package` — the installer ends up in the `release/` folder.

## How to use

| Shortcut              | What it does                          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Ctrl+Shift+Space** | Hold to talk; release when you’re done |
| **Tray icon**        | Show overlay, API keys, startup, quit |

Say things like “stop” or “cancel” to interrupt playback (Telugu and Hindi phrases work too).

**Tip:** Ask about what you actually see on the screen; the app sends a screenshot to the AI.

## What happens under the hood (short version)

1. Your mic is used only when you’re speaking (quiet parts are skipped).
2. The app takes a quick screenshot of your main screen (the overlay hides for a moment).
3. Your speech is turned into text (Cartesia).
4. The text and image go to OpenRouter (Gemini 2.5 Flash) or Gemini, which returns spoken steps.
5. Clickify reads those steps aloud (Cartesia).

A little recent chat history is sent each time so follow-up questions make sense.

## Remove audio from a video (`clip.mp4`)


If you have a file named **`clip.mp4`** (or any `.mp4`) and want **video only, no sound**, use **FFmpeg** (free, common tool).

1. Install FFmpeg if you don’t have it: [ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (or `winget install ffmpeg` on Windows).
2. Open a terminal in the folder that contains your video.
3. Run:

```bash
ffmpeg -i clip.mp4 -c copy -an clip_no_audio.mp4
```

- **`-i clip.mp4`** — your input file (change the name if yours is different).
- **`-an`** — removes all audio tracks.
- **`-c copy`** — copies the video without re-encoding (fast; same quality).

The new file is **`clip_no_audio.mp4`**. To overwrite the original instead, use a temporary name first, then rename—overwriting the same file FFmpeg is reading can cause errors.

**If you need to re-encode** (for example copy fails), try:

```bash
ffmpeg -i clip.mp4 -c:v libx264 -an clip_no_audio.mp4
```

## For developers

**You need:** Node.js, npm, and Windows (the build is set up for Windows x64).

Install and run from source:

```bash
npm install
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys. Same variables as in the table above, plus `LLM_PROVIDER` (`openrouter` or `gemini`).

```bash
npm start
```

**Build the installer:**

```bash
npm run package
```

Output: `release/` (e.g. `Clickify Setup 0.1.1.exe`).

**Project folders (overview):**

- `src/main/` — Electron main process (tray, APIs, overlay wiring)
- `src/renderer/` — Overlay UI, voice, playback
- `assets/` — App icon

---

## Publish a release

GitHub Actions builds the Windows installer (`.github/workflows/release-windows.yml`).

1. Update `version` in `package.json` if needed.
2. Create and push a tag, for example:

```bash
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin v0.1.1
```

3. Check **[Releases](https://github.com/Praveen1270/clickify/releases)** — the workflow attaches the setup `.exe`.

You can also run **Actions → Release Windows installer → Run workflow** and download the artifact.

## More detail (optional)

- **Installed app keys** live in `clickify.env` under your user data folder. While developing, that file overrides a project `.env` if both exist.
- **Models:** OpenRouter uses `google/gemini-2.5-flash`; Gemini uses `gemini-2.0-flash`. Cartesia uses `sonic-3.6` (TTS) and `ink-whisper` (STT).
- **Languages:** TTS uses `en-IN`, `hi-IN`, and `te-IN` presets.
- The overlay stays visible (opacity) during screenshots so audio recording stays stable.
